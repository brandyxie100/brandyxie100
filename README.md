## About Me
AI Full-Stack Engineer with 17 years of professional experience across internet software development and mobile game development. I focus on **AI-driven applications** and **clean architecture**: domain-driven design, test-first development, and production-ready SaaS. I enjoy turning complex product requirements into maintainable systems—from LangGraph agentic pipelines to multi-tenant backends and type-safe frontends.

## How I Work

- **Test-first:** Failing tests before implementation; coverage targets (e.g. ≥80% overall, ≥90% domain).
- **Conventional commits & PRs:** Scoped messages, small PRs, CI + review before merge.
- **Documentation:** README, architecture docs, and contributor guides so others can onboard quickly.
